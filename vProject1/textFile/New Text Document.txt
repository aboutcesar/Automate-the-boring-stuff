n Australian animated television series for preschoolers that has aired on ABC Kids since October 2018. Created by Joe Brumm, the series follows Bluey, an anthropomorphic six-year-old Blue Heeler puppy (example pictured) who engages in imaginative play with her father Bandit, mother Chilli, and younger sister Bingo. The characters of Bluey each represent a particular dog breed, some of which are drawn from Brumm's personal life; he had a Blue Heeler named Bluey throughout his childhood. Overarching themes include family, growing up, and Australian culture. The program was created and is produced in Queensland; its capital city of Brisbane inspired the show's setting. Bluey won a Logie Award for Most Outstanding Children's Program in 2019 as well as an International Emmy Kids Award. It has been praised by television critics for its depiction of modern everyday family life, constructive parenting messages and the role of Bandit as a positive father figure. (Full article...)
